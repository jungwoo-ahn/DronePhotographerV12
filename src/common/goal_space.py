"""Shot-profile goal space utilities.

The goal vector for the policy is a subset of the V5 score keys defined in

(the v6 placement JSONs include camera azimuth/elevation but not the full V5
detection-derived scores yet), so the loader tolerates missing keys by filling
NaN — callers decide whether to skip or mask those samples downstream.
