"""5D camera-action representation: (Δright, Δup, Δforward, Δyaw, Δpitch).

Translation (Δright, Δup, Δforward) is in the previous frame's camera-local basis
(Blender convention: +X=right, +Y=up, -Z=forward), in metres.

Rotation is (Δyaw, Δpitch) of where the camera AIMS, in radians:
- Δyaw   = change in the forward vector's WORLD azimuth — a rotation about the
           world up axis (+Z), positive = turn left→right about vertical.
- Δpitch = change in the forward vector's elevation — a rotation about the camera's
           local right axis (horizontal for a level camera), positive = aim up.

Why yaw about WORLD up, not camera-local up: the trajectories are level (bank == 0
relative to world up — verified in scripts/verify_conventions.py), so a camera's
orientation has only two real DOF, (azimuth, elevation). Yawing about the camera's
*local* up axis while the camera is pitched induces roll (the up vector banks),
which this 5D representation cannot encode — so applying such an action would miss
the true (level) endpoint, badly for large moves (offset-24 chunks were ~11°/0.5m
off). Yawing about the *world* up axis keeps the camera level, so every real
endpoint is reachable with zero roll and an encoded action chunk composes back onto
the endpoint exactly.
