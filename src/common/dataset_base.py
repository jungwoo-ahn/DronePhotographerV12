"""Base Dataset over v7 trajectory windows.

Each sample is a K-step window from one of a placement's `accepted_pairs[i].trajectory_32f`:
the (start_frame, end_frame, chunk_size · ACTION_DIM action chunk, hindsight-relabeled
goal). Subclasses (`src/policy/cosmos/dataset.py`) shape the per-sample dict
into model-specific tensors.

Goal relabeling (HER-"future"): the goal profile is NOT pinned to the window's
end frame. With `goal_sampling="uniform_future"` (default), each `__getitem__`
draws the goal frame uniformly from [end_frame, last_frame] of the same
trajectory — the action chunk and next-frame target stay anchored to the window
(they are the *consequence* of the actions), while the goal vector and value
target follow the drawn frame. This decouples the goal horizon from the action
horizon: the conditioner and value head see goals at every distance 8..31
steps out, matching inference-time goals that are not 8 steps away.
`goal_sampling="end"` restores the legacy fixed-offset behavior.

Sampling scheme: `sampling_scheme="multiscale_bidir"` replaces the sliding window
with bidirectional multi-scale endpoints — per start frame, one window per signed
offset ±o (o in `offsets`, e.g. ±8/±16/±24) whose endpoint exists. The goal is the
endpoint the actions actually reach, so the SAME start with DIFFERENT endpoints
yields DIFFERENT action targets, forcing the policy to condition on the goal (the
fix for actions collapsing to `f(state)`). See `iter_multiscale_windows`.

Value: `Sample.value` is a per-step sequence (chunk_size,) — `value[k]` is the
negative geometric distance from the pre-action keyframe `k` to the goal (value[0]
is the legacy START→GOAL scalar).

Randomness uses the global numpy RNG, which torch's DataLoader re-seeds per
worker per epoch — repeated `__getitem__(i)` calls may return different goals
by design (sliding_window only; multiscale pins the goal to the endpoint).
