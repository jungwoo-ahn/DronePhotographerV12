"""Closed-loop evaluation: does the policy actually REACH the requested shot?

Training curves and the goal-dependence probe both say the policy *uses* the goal.
Neither says it *gets there*. v11 passed the first test and failed this one — its
world-model variant looked better on sampled action MSE while being worse in
rollout — so this is the measurement that decides anything.

Protocol, per episode:
  1. Pick a real (start, goal) pair from a held-out placement.
  2. Put the camera at the start pose in Blender and render what it sees.
  3. Ask the policy for an 8-step action chunk, conditioned on that frame and on
     the goal prompt.
  4. Execute the chunk in the Blender env, re-rendering as it goes.
  5. Measure how much closer to the goal pose the camera ended up.

The headline number is improvement over doing nothing:

    improvement = d(start, goal) − d(end, goal)

positive means the camera moved toward the requested shot. Reported against the
no-op baseline explicitly, because a policy that barely moves scores ~0 and a
policy that thrashes scores negative — both are failures that a raw distance
would flatter. `d` is the geometric pose distance from `src/common/reward.py`
(view angle, apparent size and aim, all in radians), the same metric the value
target uses.

Usage (see scripts/sbatch_closed_loop_eval.sh for the wrapper that sets the env):

    python scripts/closed_loop_eval.py \
        --checkpoint runs/train/.../checkpoints/iter_000005000 \
        --episodes 24 --out runs/closed_loop/iter5000.json

    prompt ends with a crop phrase and a `visible` number. Omitting it here made every
    rollout so far ask the policy with a prompt shape it had never seen.

    Training prompts carry `idle_frame`, and the stock inference path drops it, so
    pass mode/idle_frames explicitly — otherwise the prompt drifts from training in
    a way that is invisible until the numbers come out wrong.

    `idle_frames` is a knob because that field LEAKS the shoot label. Measured over 6000
    exported episodes: idle_frames > 0 => shoot=1 in 896/896 (100%), idle_frames == 0 =>
